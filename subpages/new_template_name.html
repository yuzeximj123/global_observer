<p class="news-summary">In 2023, the United States experienced a robust economic period, characterized by significant resilience. The year marked a transition into structural inflation, posing unique challenges to both businesses and consumers. Concurrently, interest rates witnessed a substantial rise, reflecting efforts to stabilize the economy and curb inflationary pressures. A noteworthy development was the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit, largely attributed to the strengthened North American Free Trade Zone, signaling a shift in international trade dynamics and domestic economic strategies.</p>

From tackling inflation to adapting to new trade dynamics and harnessing technology for growth, the path ahead is lined with opportunities and challenges.
